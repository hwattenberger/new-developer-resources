# new-developer-resources
List of some of the resources a newer, JS-focused developer would find helpful

### Books/Reading Resources
- [Eloquent Javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) - Good intro book for JS (free)
- [Javascript.info](https://javascript.info/) - Great resource for learning not only the basics but also more advanced topics of JS. They also have detailed practice exercises.
- [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/tree/1st-ed) - Very technical resource for JS. I thought it was really interesting but likely isn't needed for almost any especially intro job
